#7. LIst Comprehensions

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/list-comprehensions/problem

#Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integersx,yand z  representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n. Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of (i+j+k) is not equal to n. 
#Here, 0<=i<=0;
#0<=j<=y;
#0<=k<z.
#Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.

x = int(input())
y = int(input())
z = int(input())
n = int(input())

l = [[i,j,k] for i in (x+1) for j in (y+1) for k in (z+1 if (i+j+k) != n)]
print(l)
