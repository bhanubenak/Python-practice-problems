n = int(input()) # size of the scores array

    arr = map(int, input().split())  #getting input from the user

    set_list = list(set(arr))    # creating a list varaible which holds only unique values which is achieved by using set() function 
    max_num = max(set_list)      # finding maximum number from the array
    
    set_list.remove(max_num)     # now, removing the max number from the list
    
    second_max_num = max(set_list)    # now, again finding the max number
    print(second_max_num)             # printing the second max number
